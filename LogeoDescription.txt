

This is an application that allows you to explore the whole dataset on a map. Also, it leverages the dataset to implement a similarity model, to guess the city of any text you input.

You can do the following things within the app:

 Find the regional origin of a text in Spanish.

 Enter a text. (a tweet, a song lyrics a piece of news or your own text). See which cities are the most similar to the text you entered. 

 Just explore the data set on a map.

 Enter one word. See the cities in which the word is used with the highest frequency. Click on the circles on the map to open a word cloud with the most similar words in each city, morphologically and semantically.

 Compare two words. Enter two words to see the cities in which these are used with the highest frequency. Something akin to Google trends.


Click on any country name. See the most frequent or unique words for that country. 


#Tools
I used [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to read and process the dataset. 
For text/natural language processing, I used [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/). 
To plot the cities on a map, I used [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium). 
And finally, I used [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to build a small web app, which I learned to host on Digital Ocean.
